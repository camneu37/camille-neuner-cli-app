# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application: I have met this requirement as my program presents options to the user in the command line and allows the user to enter their selections to view more information in the command line.
- [x] Pull data from an external source: I have met this requirement as my program scrapes series' information from Showtime's website.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views: I have met this requirement as my program is capable of showing lists of all series available on Showtime and is also capable of showing the details (summary and number of seasons/episodes) for each individual show.
